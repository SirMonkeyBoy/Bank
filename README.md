# Bank

Bank Plugin for Minecraft

Commands:
- `/bank` Will give you a list of subcommands
- `/bank balance` Give bank balance 
- `/bank depost` Deposit to your bank
- `/bank withdraw` Withdraws from your bank

I made this as I wanted a Bank plugin that stores its data in a database.

It supports MariaDB it will probalby will work with MySQL as well.
