# Kingdom Bank

Kingdom Bank is a Plugin made for the Minecraft server software PaperMC

Commands:
- `/bank` Will give you a list of subcommands
- `/bank balance` Shows your bank balance 
- `/bank deposit` Deposits to your bank
- `/bank withdraw` Withdraws from your bank
- `/banktop` Shows you the top 10 bank balances

Features:
- Stores all balances in a MariaDB database
- Keeps a record of all Transactions
- It supports MariaDB

I made this Project for fun as I wanted a Bank plugin that stores its data in a database and also tracks the deposit and withdraws from it.
